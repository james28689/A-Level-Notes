# Hardware and Software
**Hardware** - Physical parts of a computer on which software runs, such as the motherboard, CPU, input, and output devices.
**Software** - all written programs that make a computer function as intended.

### System Software:
Software needed to control computer hardware and run application software. E.g: OS, antivrus, disk defragmenter.
- **Operating System** - a set of programs that manages the operations of the computer. It allows users to use hardware trough application or system software. It’s main roles include presenting a GUI (graphical user interface), managing memory, and managing multi-tasking on the CPU – this involves the use of a **scheduler**, which ensures all processes get CPU time and the hardware can be used efficiently.
- **Utility Programs** - programs designed to help configure, optimise, or maintain the computer. E.g: antivirus, encryption, backup software, etc.
- **Libraries** - a collection of pre-written programs to allow other programs to run or to be developed. These significantly speed up development, and work across multiple applications.
- **Translators** - Allow programs to be translated into machine code so that programs can be run on a computer.
-- ***Interpreters*** - convert high level languages into machine code one instruction at a time as the program is running.
-- ***Compilers*** - convert high-level languages into machine code before the program is run, the machine code is saved so that the source code can be discarded – this is how software is normally distributed.
-- ***Assembler*** - converts assembly language instructions into machine code. There is a one-to-one correspondence between assembly code instructions and machine code instructions.
