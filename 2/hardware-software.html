        <p>
        <strong>Hardware</strong> - Physical parts of a computer on which software
        runs, such as the motherboard, CPU, input, and output devices.<br />
        <strong>Software</strong> - all written programs that make a computer
        function as intended.
        </p>

        <h2>Software Classificaion:</h2>
        <p>
        Software is split into 2 broad categories: application software, and
        system software - these can be further divided.
        </p>

        <h3>Application Software:</h3>
        <p>
        Software that performs one or a set of tasks for users. E.g: word
        processor, browser.
        </p>
        <p>This can in turn be broken down into 3 groups:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>General Purpose</strong> - software designed to be widely used
            in many ways, such as a word processor
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Specialist</strong> - software that performs a specific task
            designed for a specific business, scientific, or educational area - such
            as payroll or air traffic control software.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Bespoke</strong> - tailor-made software created to fulfil a
            specific task for a particular user or organization. It is very
            expensive but fits the needs of the buyer. E.g: track and trace software
        </li>
        </ul>

        <h3><a></a>System Software:</h3>
        <p>
        Software needed to control computer hardware and run application software.
        E.g: OS, antivrus, disk defragmenter.
        </p>
        <h4>Operating Systems</h4>
        <p>
        A set of programs that manages the operations of the computer. It allows
        users to use hardware through application of system software. It's main
        roles include:
        </p>
        <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Operating System</strong> - a set of programs that manages the
            operations of the computer. It allows users to use hardware trough
            application or system software. It’s main roles include presenting a GUI
            (graphical user interface), managing memory, and managing multi-tasking
            on the CPU – this involves the use of a <strong>scheduler</strong>,
            which ensures all processes get CPU time and the hardware can be used
            efficiently.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Utility Programs</strong> - programs designed to help configure,
            optimise, or maintain the computer. E.g: antivirus, encryption, backup
            software, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Libraries</strong> - a collection of pre-written programs to
            allow other programs to run or to be developed. These significantly
            speed up development, and work across multiple applications.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Translators</strong> - Allow programs to be translated into
            machine code so that programs can be run on a computer.
        </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Classification of Programming Languages:</h2>
        <p>
        Programming languages can be classified as low or high level languages.
        </p>

        <h3>Low Level</h3>
        <p>
        These languages have a low level of seperation (or abstraction) from the
        underlying hardware, they are similar to or based on the instruction set
        of the computer. E.g: Assembly language, machine code.
        </p>
        <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Machine Code</strong> - expressed in binary (computers
            understand this). All codes must be translated to machine code, which is
            specific to a processor. Made up of two parts; the operator (identifies
            task - e.g: add), and the operand (value or memory address the
            instruction should be operated on).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Assembly</strong> - provides basic computer instructions for
            programs to run. One to one relationship between machine code
            instructions and assembly. Uses names (mnemonics). Each type of
            processor has it's own assembly language
        </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Advantages:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>
            Produce better optimised and so more efficient code than high level
            languages. hey are appropriate for developing Operating Systems,
            embedded systems, and hardware drivers.
        </li>
        <li>
            Low level languages are sometimes the only possibility for controlling
            certain systems
        </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Disadvantages:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Difficult to understand and modify</li>
        <li>Written for specific processor or architecture, so not portable</li>
        <li>
            One-to-one correspondence with machine code, so time consuming compared
            to high level
        </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>High Level</h3>
        <p>
        These languages have a high level of seperation from the actual operations
        of the computer so programmers can focus on solving problems. They are
        closer to English and therefore easier to understand. They are independent
        of the processor architecture so are very portable. One instruction maps
        onto several machine code instructions.
        </p>
        <p>Advantages:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Allow programmers to write more portable code</li>
        <li>Easier to understand and modify</li>
        <li>
            Take less time to write as a single instruction maps to several machine
            code instructions
        </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Disadvantages:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>
            Needs a compiler or interpreter which is not always available
            particularly for embedded systems
        </li>
        <li>Run slower as the layers of abstraction introduce inefficiency.</li>
        </ul>

		<h3>Translators:</h4>
        <ul>
        <li>
            <strong><em>Interpreters</em></strong> - convert high level languages
            into machine code one instruction at a time as the program is running.
            Each instruction is converted after the previous one has been executed.
            Good for debugging code but runs much slower than compiled code. The
            machine code is not saved.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong><em>Compilers</em></strong> - convert high-level languages into
            machine code before the program is run, the machine code is saved so
            that the source code can be discarded - it is faster than interpreted
            code. This is how software is normally distributed, as it stops users
            editing or copying the code.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong><em>Assembler</em></strong> - converts assembly language
            instructions into machine code. There is a one-to-one correspondence
            between assembly code instructions and machine code instructions.
        </li>
        </ul>

		<h3>Source Code and Object Code</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The source code is used to write the code in the high-level language. This cannot be executed on its own.</li>
			<li>Object code is machine code that has been translated from the source code. This can be executed</li>
			<li>Software is normally distributed as compiled machine code. This can be useful as others cannot copy or edit the code and use it for their own applications.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Intermediate Code</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Intermediate code is source code that has been translated into a standard form.</li>
			<li>This means that the source code does not need to be distributed.</li>
			<li>It is not executable, but is converted just before running.</li>
			<li>It needs to run on a range of platforms so is portable, but each computer that it runs on needs to have a compiler developed for that architecture.</li>
