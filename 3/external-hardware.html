			<h2>Barcodes</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Barcodes are used all over the world to keep track of products, items, etc.</li>
				<li>Barcodes contain and encode data, the alternating black and white sections provide seperation of each character.</li>
				<li>There are two types of barcode:</li>
				<ol>
					<li>Linear Barcode (1D) - vertical stripes of various thickness.</li>
					<li>2D Barcodes - like the Quick Response (QR) code.</li>
				</ol>
				<li>2D barcodes encode a larger quantity of data. This means they can store more information, like texts, URLs, or small files</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Barcode Use</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Barcodes are used to allow computers to read the code and extract the information contained within it, in order to input that data into a computer.</li>
				<li>This is significantly faster than entering it by hand, and far more accurate.</li>
				<li>They were first used commercially to track train carriages, with detectors at stations and junctions tracking the location of carriages quickly and accurately</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Reading Barcodes</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Laser Scanners:</strong></li>
				<ul>
					<li>The scanner contains a laser beam which shines through a rotating prism, making it scan rapidly from left-to-right creating a visible red band. The dark bars in the barcode absorb this light, while white spaces reflect it.</li>
					<li>The scanner detects the intensity of the light reflected back, this generates a waveform that mimics the widths of the bars and spaces in the barcode.</li>
					<li>The returned data is already in binary form, so reading/converting is very simple and reliable.</li>
					<li>This is decoded and sent to the computer as a digital signal.</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
			<h2>Digital Cameras</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Digital cameras use a grid of tiny light sensors to measure the amount of light passing through the lens when the shutters are open.</li>
				<li>Each sensor measures the colour and brightness of each pixel.</li>
				<li>Each sensor turns the light into electricity and the amount of charge is stored as binary data.</li>
				<li>The binary data is then recorded onto the camera's memory card.</li>
				<li>Images can be produced using appropriate image software.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Sensors:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>A digital camera uses two types of sensors: CCD or CMOS.</li>
				<li><strong>CCD</strong> - couple charged device. Transports tje charge across the chip and reads it at one corner of the array. An ACD turns each pixel's value into a digital value by measuring the charge at each photosite and converting this measurement to binary. Higher quality but more </li>
				<li><strong>CMOS</strong> - complementary metal oxide semiconductor. Use several transistors at each pixel to amplify and move the charge using traditional wires.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Printers</h2>
			<h3>Laser Printers</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Uses powdered ink, called toner. A computer sends data to be printed and the onboard circuit works out how to print the data.</li>
				<li>It generates a bitmap of the data. This is printed by a laser beam which scans back and forth across a drum inside the printer, building ip a pattern of static electricity. The static electricity attracts toner onto the page. The ink is then cured by two hot rollers.</li>
				<li>Advantages:</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Laser printers are more reliable.</li>
					<li>Can store more ink and can print faster than inkjet.</li>
					<li>Higher upfront cost, cheaper ink.</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
			<h3>Inkjet</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Liquid ink is sprayed onto the page in the correct places.</li>
				<li>Advantages:</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Can be smaller than laser printers.</li>
					<li>Cheaper than laser printers.</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
			<h2>RFID</h2>
			<p>Used to identify objects. RFID devices contain coils and a small chip, a reader induces a current into the coil which gives the chip enough power to transmit it's data. There are two types, Active and Passive. In active RFID the chip is powered by a power supply giving it a larger range (300 meters). RFID tags can be written so can be used to store data - which can also be overwritten.</p>
			<h3>Uses</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>ID, passports</li>
				<li>Stock control</li>
				<li>Parts tracing</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Secondary Storage</h2>
			<h3>Secondary Storage</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Used to store data and programs.</li>
				<li>Non-volatile (data not lost when turned off).</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Magnetic Drives</h3>
			<p>Magnets on platters can be read and flipped by a read/write head, the magnets are laid out in rings, called tracks.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Very cheap</li>
				<li>Slow</li>
				<li>Less reliable due to moving parts</li>
				<li>Data can be lost due to EM surges</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Optical Disks</h3>
			<p>Tracks on the disk contain pits and lands, the track is a spiral which is followed by laser. Pits absorb the laser whereas lands reflect them, creating a binary signal which can be read by a photodiode.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Portable</li>
				<li>Widely recognised</li>
				<li>No internet connection required (compared to streaming)</li>
				<li>Fragile</li>
				<li>Most are single write, re-writable disks also only have limited re-writes.</li>
				<li>Cannot store very large amounts of data</li>
				<li>Good for the sale of media (movies and music)</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Solid State Storage (SSD)</h3>
			<p>Consist of millions of NAND flash memory cells and a controller that manages pages and blocks and complexities of writing.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Based on floating gate transistors that trap and store charge. Each cell is a floating gate transistor</li>
				<li>A typical flash memory grid has 32 to 256 columns (bit lines), and many rows (word lines). The total grid is named a block, and each row is named a page.</li>
				<li>Each cell can change its state between charge and no charge.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Advantages/Disadvantages:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Smaller and lighter</li>
				<li>Significantly faster read/write</li>
				<li>More expensive than hard drives</li>
				<li>Very energy efficient</li>
				<li>Much more durable (resistant to shock and vibrations)</li>
				<li>Silent</li>
				<li>Much longer lifetime</li>
			</ul>
